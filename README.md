# 2cents

Despite fully believing that it is a force for good and a beutiful anachronism from a brighter time on this digital plane, I have never donated to Wikipedia.

Instead of interrogating this, I closed the gap between intention and action with sweet, sweet technology.

2cents is a chrome extension that automatically donates an amount of your choosing to Wikipedia for each distinct wiki article you read every week.

Built with js, stripe
Uses google oauth based on the chrome browser profile
